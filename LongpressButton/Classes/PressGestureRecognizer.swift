/**
 Gesture recognizer simulating long press.
 
 1. begins as soon as user taches the button with 1 finger -> user begun interaction
 2. after minimumPressDuration elapses state is changed  -> long press was initiated
 3. after requiredPressDuration elapeses state is changed to finished -> long press recognized
 4. in every other case state is changed to cancelled -> long press cancelled
 
 - Note: difference between PressGestureRecognizer and UILongPressGestureRecognizer is that
 the former changes state to `begin` imediatelly, while the latter begins only after `minimumPressDuration`
 is elapsed. And we need to track when user begun the interaction.
